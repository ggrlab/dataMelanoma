Dataset integration was based on gene name;  multiple entries for the same gene name were integrated to a single entry by  calculating the median expression value. Data were normalized by subtracting  most frequent value in each sample. To extract DEPs between responders and  non-responders multiple comparisons were performed; a two-sample Student's ttest  was performed with a p value threshold of 0.05 for each of the two datasets,  following by 2D annotation enrichment test (Cox and Mann, 2012) with FDR q-value  0.02 to derive the differential functional groups in each of the two datasets.  A two-sample Student's t test with a permutation-based FDR q-value of 0.1 and  S0 (Tusher et al., 2001) of 0.1 was performed for the anti-PD1 dataset or the  combined dataset of both treatments, to extract significantly changing proteins. Initial bioinformatic analysis examined the functional differences between  responders and non-responders in each therapy.
