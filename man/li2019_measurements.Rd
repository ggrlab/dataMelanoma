\description{
Samples in the studies were measured at baseline and at weeks 4, 6 and 8. Not all
samples were measured at all timepoints. The measurements are stored in a list
with 4 elements, one for each study. Each element is a list a tibble for each timepoint.

Each tibble starts with a column \code{Unique_Subject_Identifier} that identifies
the sample. The remaining columns are the measurements.
